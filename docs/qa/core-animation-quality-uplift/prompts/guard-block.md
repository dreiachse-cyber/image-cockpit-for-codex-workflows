Direction contract: front faces camera; front-three-quarter is diagonal-front; side is strict profile; back-three-quarter is diagonal-back; back is true straight rear view with no eyes, nose, mouth, cheek, or looking-over-shoulder pose.

Cell contract: keep the full head, hair silhouette, hands, props, effects, and both feet inside each cell with 24 px padding whenever possible. Keep feet on a stable visual ground line and keep the character centered across frames.

Effect / prop contract: projectiles, shields, weapons, hand items, and magic effects must stay compact and inside their own cell. They must not hide the face, torso, feet, or action silhouette.

Negative constraints: no cropped head, missing feet, duplicated heads, body fragments, non-flat background, opaque background, guide residue, cell bleed, identity drift, direction mismatch, gore, readable text, UI symbols, labels, speech bubbles, or oversized effects.
